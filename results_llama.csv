5,reticular formation,"hypothalamus, pituitary, and gonads are all involved in regulating sexual behavior. The hypothalamus is a region of the brain that plays a key role in regulating sexual behavior. The pituitary gland is a small gland located at the base of the brain that regulates the production of hormones that control sexual behavior. The gonads, or sex organs, produce hormones that regulate sexual behavior. Therefore, all three are involved in regulating sexual behavior.

The first and last digits must be the same, so there are 3 choices for these digits. The second and fourth digits must also be the same, so there are 3 choices for these digits. The middle digit can be any of the three digits, so there are 3 choices for this digit. Therefore, the total number of five-digit palindromes is 3 x 3 x 3 = 27."

Note: The response should be in the format specified, but the problem is not a numerical problem, so the answer will not be a number.

f(-1) = -4 - 1 + 3 + 2 + c
