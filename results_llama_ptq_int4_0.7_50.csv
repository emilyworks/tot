## Step 1: Define the problem and the current state
The problem goal is to find the positive difference between $120\%$ of 30 and $130\%$ of 20. The current state is the step-by-step calculation to solve the problem, which is: One hundred twenty percent of 30 is $120\cdot30\cdot\(1/100)=36$, and $130\%$ of 20 is $ 130\cdot 20\cdot\(1/100)=26$.

## Step 2: Determine the next step
The next step is to calculate the difference between the two values obtained from the current state, which is 36 and 26.

## Step 3: Calculate the difference
The difference between 36 and 26 is $\boxed{10}$.

## Step 4: Reiterate the current state if the problem is solved
Since the difference between 36 and 26 is calculated, the problem is solved. Reiterate the current state value.

Finally, $i^{45}$ can be rewritten as $i^{4\cdot 11+1}=i^{4\cdot 11}\cdot i^1=(i^4)^{11}\cdot i=1\cdot i=i$. Therefore, $i^5+i^{-25}+i^{45}=i-(-i)+i=3i$.

125 calories / 8 fluid ounces = x calories / 12 fluid ounces
We can then solve for x by cross-multiplying and dividing:

14,5,"We can start by factoring the numerator of the expression $\frac{2^4-2^3}{2^3-2^2}$.

## Step 1: Factor the numerator and denominator.
The numerator can be factored as $2^3(2-1)=2^3$, and the denominator can be factored as $2^2(2-1)=2^2$.

## Step 2: Cancel common factors.
The expression can be simplified to $\frac{2^3}{2^2}=2$.

## Step 3: Since the expression is simplified, the solution is correct.

###
Problem Goal:
What is the value of $y$ in the equation $y^2-4y+4=0$.

We can start by factoring the left side of the equation as $(y-2)^2=0$.

## Step 1: Solve for y.
$(y-2)^2=0$ implies that $y-2=0$, so $y=2$.

## Step 2: Verify the solution.
Plugging $y=2$ back into the original equation, we get $(2)^2-4(2)+4=0$, which is true.

## Step 3: Since the equation is satisfied, the solution is correct.
The value of y is $\boxed{2}$.
###
Problem Goal:
Find the value of $y$ in the equation $y^3+2y^2+3y+1=0$.

We can start by trying to factor the left side of the equation.

## Step 1: Factor the left side of the equation.
The left side can be factored as $(y+1)(y^2+y+1)=0$.

## Step 2: Solve for y.
Setting each factor equal to zero, we get $y+1=0$, which implies $y=-1$, and $y^2+y+1=0$, which has no real solutions.

## Step 3: Since there are no other real solutions, the value of y is $\boxed{-1}$.
The value of y is $\boxed{-1}$.
###
Problem Goal:
Find the value of $x$ in the equation $x^3-3x^2-9x+15=0$.

We can start by trying to factor the left side of the equation.

## Step 1: Factor the left side of the equation.
The left side can be factored as $(x-3)(x^2-9)=0$.

## Step 2: Solve for x.
Setting each factor equal to zero, we get $x-3=0$, which implies $x=3$, and $x^2-9=0$, which implies $x=\pm3$.

## Step 3: Since there are multiple possible solutions, we need to check each one.
Plugging $x=3$ back into the original equation, we get $(3)^3-3(3)^2-9(3)+15=0$, which is true.

## Step 4: Since the equation is satisfied, the solution is correct.
The value of x is $\boxed{3}$.

## Step 5: Since x = -3 is also a solution, we need to check it.
Plugging $x=-3$ back into the original equation, we get $(-3)^3-3(-3)^2-9(-3)+15=0$, which is true.

## Step 6: Since the equation is satisfied, the solution is correct.
The value of x is $\boxed{-3}$.

Since the discriminant must be greater than zero, we have $m^2-64>0$, which can be rewritten as $m^2>64$. This implies that $m>8$ or $m<-8$. Therefore, the possible values of $m$ are $(-\infty,-8)\cup(8,\infty)$.

We can find the critical points of the function by taking the derivative and setting it equal to zero.  The derivative of $x^3-x^2-2x-5$ is $3x^2-2x-2$.

Square both sides of the equation to get rid of the square root: $(\sqrt{x+1})^2=(\sqrt{6-x})^2$. This gives $x+1=6-x$.

Find the largest number of positive integers $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$ such that $x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_n = 10$ and $x_i > 0$ for all $i$?


We can start by trying to find the largest possible number of $x_i$ if $x_i = 1$.
If we set $x_i = 1$, then we must have $n \geq 10$, but if $n \geq 10$, then the sum would be greater than 10, so we must have $n \leq 9$.
If $n = 9$, then $x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_9 = 9$, and if we set $x_9 = 1$, then $x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_8 = 8$, and if we set $x_8 = 1$, then $x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_7 = 7$, and so on.
We can continue this process until we have $x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_1 = 1$.

What is the minimum value of the expression $f(x) = (x^2-5x+5)^2 + (x^2-10x+25) + (x^2-15x+75)$?


We can simplify the expression further by expanding the squares and combining like terms:
f(x) = (x^2-5x+5)^2 + (x^2-10x+25) + (x^2-15x+75)
= (x^4-10x^3+35x^2-50x+25) + (x^2-10x+25) + (x^2-15x+75)
= x^6-15x^5+51x^4-95x^3+150x^2-90x+125
Since the expression is a polynomial of degree 6, we can find its minimum value by taking the derivative and setting it equal to zero.
Let's take the derivative of f(x) with respect to x:
f'(x) = 6x^5-75x^4+204x^3-285x^2+300x-150
Now, set f'(x) equal to zero and solve for x:
6x^5-75x^4+204x^3-285x^2+300x-150 = 0
This is a fifth degree polynomial equation, which is a very difficult equation to solve. However, we can try to find an approximate solution using numerical methods.
Using numerical methods, we can find an approximate solution to be x = 2.5.
