## Step 1: Understand the problem and the current state
The problem is to evaluate the expression $i^5+i^{-25}+i^{45}$. The current state is the result of simplifying the powers of $i$: $i^5 = i$, $i^{-25} = i^{-24} \cdot i^{-1} = i$, and $i^{45} = i^{44} \cdot i = i$.

## Step 2: Substitute the simplified values into the original expression
Substitute the simplified values of $i^5$, $i^{-25}$, and $i^{45}$ into the original expression: $i^5 + i^{-25} + i^{45} = i - i - 1$.

11,8,"Since we found the values of A, B, and C that satisfy the equation, we can conclude that the problem is solved, and the final answer is 13.
However, the problem statement asks for a possible next step to solve the problem from the current state, not the final answer. In this case, the next step is to try different values of A until we find one that satisfies the equation.

### Problem Goal:
If $A$, $B$ and $C$ are positive integers such that $\frac{A\sqrt{B}}{C} = \frac{9}{2\sqrt{3}}$, what is the value of $A+B+C$ given that $A$ and $C$ have no common prime factors, and $B$ has no perfect-square factors other than 1?


## Step 1: Analyze the equation
We need to find the value of A+B+C. To start, we need to analyze the given equation and simplify it.

## Step 2: Simplify the equation
We can simplify the equation by multiplying both sides by 2*sqrt(3) to get A*sqrt(B) = (9/(2*sqrt(3))) * (2*sqrt(3)) = 9.

## Step 3: Isolate A
We can isolate A by dividing both sides by sqrt(B) to get A = 9 / sqrt(B).

## Step 4: Simplify B
We can simplify B by using the fact that sqrt(B) = sqrt(27/A^2) = sqrt(27)/A = 3*sqrt(3)/A.

## Step 5: Substitute B into the equation for A
We can substitute B into the equation for A to get A = 9 / (3*sqrt(3)/A) = 3*A / sqrt(3).

## Step 6: Simplify the equation for A
We can simplify the equation for A by multiplying both sides by sqrt(3) to get A*sqrt(3) = 3*A.

## Step 7: Solve for A
We can solve for A by dividing both sides by A to get sqrt(3) = 3.

## Step 8: Solve for A
However, this equation is not true, so we must try another approach.

## Step 9: Simplify the equation for B
We can simplify the equation for B by using the fact that A*sqrt(B) = 9.

## Step 10: Substitute A into the equation for B
We can substitute A into the equation for B to get sqrt(B) = 9/A.

## Step 11: Square both sides
We can square both sides to get B = (9/A)^2 = 81/A^2.

## Step 12: Consider possible values for A
Since A and C have no common prime factors, A must be a multiple of 3.

## Step 13: Try A = 3
If A = 3, then B = 81/9 = 9, which means C = 9/3 = 3. However, this contradicts the fact that A and C have no common prime factors.

## Step 14: Try A = 9
If A = 9, then B = 81/81 = 1, which means C = 9/3 = 3. This is a possible solution.

## Step 15: Calculate A + B + C
We can calculate A + B + C = 9 + 1 + 3 = 13.

The final answer is: $\boxed{13}$"

We know that the total ratio is $5+3=8$, and that the total number of students is 200.  Thus, each student represents $\frac{1}{8}$ of the total number of students.  Therefore, there are $200\cdot\frac{1}{8}=25$ students that represent the $5$ in the ratio.  Since the boys make up $5$ parts of the $8$ total, the number of boys is $25\cdot\frac{5}{8}=\boxed{19.375}$.

Note: I will provide the next step for the problem, but you can modify it to fit your needs. Also, please let me know if you would like me to generate more problems. 

## Step 1: Understand the problem goal and current state.
The problem goal is to find out how much Mike will be offered in 12 more years for the stamp, and the current state is that the final price Mike will be offered in 12 more years is $\boxed{40}$ dollars.

## Step 2: Identify the pattern of the stamp's offer price.
The stamp's offer price doubles every three years.

## Step 3: Determine the number of times the offer price will double in 12 years.
Since the offer price doubles every three years, in 12 years, it will double 4 times.

## Step 4: Calculate the final offer price.
The initial offer price is $\$1.25$. Since it doubles 4 times, we can calculate the final offer price as $\$1.25 \cdot 2^4 = \$1.25 \cdot 16 = \$20$.

Use the AM-GM inequality to show that $\frac{1}{a_1^2} + \frac{1}{a_2^2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{a_n^2} \geq \frac{n}{a_1a_2\cdots a_n}$.
###
## Step 1: Apply the AM-GM inequality
By the AM-GM inequality, we have $\frac{a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \cdots + a_n^2}{n} \geq \sqrt[n]{a_1^2a_2^2\cdots a_n^2} = a_1a_2\cdots a_n$.

## Step 2: Rearrange the inequality
We can rearrange the inequality to get $\frac{1}{a_1^2} + \frac{1}{a_2^2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{a_n^2} \geq \frac{n}{a_1a_2\cdots a_n}$.

## Step 3: Use the given statement
Since $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ are the first $n$ terms of a sequence of real numbers, we have $a_1a_2\cdots a_n \geq 0$.

We can use the inequality from step 2 to show that the sum of the reciprocals of the squares of these terms is less than or equal to $\frac{1}{a_1^2} + \frac{1}{a_2^2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{a_n^2}$.

149,108,"The number of revolutions is 108.

Please provide a step-by-step solution for this problem and I'll be happy to help with the next problem. 

## Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem involves two horses, one 64 feet from the center of a merry-go-round and the other 16 feet from the center. We need to find out how many revolutions the second horse needs to make to travel the same distance as the first horse, who makes 27 revolutions.

## Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled by the first horse
The distance traveled by the first horse can be calculated using the formula for the circumference of a circle (C = 2πr), where r is the radius of the circle. The radius for the first horse is 64 feet, so the distance traveled is 2π(64) = 128π feet.

## Step 3: Calculate the total distance traveled by the first horse in 27 revolutions
Since the first horse makes 27 revolutions, we multiply the distance traveled in one revolution by 27. The total distance traveled by the first horse is 27(128π) = 3456π feet.

## Step 4: Set up the equation for the second horse
The second horse needs to travel the same distance as the first horse. We can set up the equation 2πx = 3456π, where x is the number of revolutions the second horse needs to make.

## Step 5: Solve for x
To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2π, resulting in x = 3456π / 2π = 1728.

## Step 6: However, we made an error in our calculations. Let's redo step 5.
