## Step 1: Define the problem and the current state
The problem goal is to find the positive difference between $120\%$ of 30 and $130\%$ of 20. The current state is the step-by-step calculation to solve the problem, which is: One hundred twenty percent of 30 is $120\cdot30\cdot\(1/100)=36$, and $130\%$ of 20 is $ 130\cdot 20\cdot\(1/100)=26$.

## Step 2: Determine the next step
The next step is to calculate the difference between the two values obtained from the current state, which is 36 and 26.

## Step 3: Calculate the difference
The difference between 36 and 26 is $\boxed{10}$.

## Step 4: Reiterate the current state if the problem is solved
Since the difference between 36 and 26 is calculated, the problem is solved. Reiterate the current state value.

Finally, $i^{45}$ can be rewritten as $i^{4\cdot 11+1}=i^{4\cdot 11}\cdot i^1=(i^4)^{11}\cdot i=1\cdot i=i$. Therefore, $i^5+i^{-25}+i^{45}=i-(-i)+i=3i$.

125 calories / 8 fluid ounces = x calories / 12 fluid ounces
We can then solve for x by cross-multiplying and dividing:

14,5,"We can start by factoring the numerator of the expression $\frac{2^4-2^3}{2^3-2^2}$.

## Step 1: Factor the numerator and denominator.
The numerator can be factored as $2^3(2-1)=2^3$, and the denominator can be factored as $2^2(2-1)=2^2$.

## Step 2: Cancel common factors.
The expression can be simplified to $\frac{2^3}{2^2}=2$.

## Step 3: Since the expression is simplified, the solution is correct.

###
Problem Goal:
What is the value of $y$ in the equation $y^2-4y+4=0$.

We can start by factoring the left side of the equation as $(y-2)^2=0$.

## Step 1: Solve for y.
$(y-2)^2=0$ implies that $y-2=0$, so $y=2$.

## Step 2: Verify the solution.
Plugging $y=2$ back into the original equation, we get $(2)^2-4(2)+4=0$, which is true.

## Step 3: Since the equation is satisfied, the solution is correct.
The value of y is $\boxed{2}$.
###
Problem Goal:
Find the value of $y$ in the equation $y^3+2y^2+3y+1=0$.

We can start by trying to factor the left side of the equation.

## Step 1: Factor the left side of the equation.
The left side can be factored as $(y+1)(y^2+y+1)=0$.

## Step 2: Solve for y.
Setting each factor equal to zero, we get $y+1=0$, which implies $y=-1$, and $y^2+y+1=0$, which has no real solutions.

## Step 3: Since there are no other real solutions, the value of y is $\boxed{-1}$.
The value of y is $\boxed{-1}$.
###
Problem Goal:
Find the value of $x$ in the equation $x^3-3x^2-9x+15=0$.

We can start by trying to factor the left side of the equation.

## Step 1: Factor the left side of the equation.
The left side can be factored as $(x-3)(x^2-9)=0$.

## Step 2: Solve for x.
Setting each factor equal to zero, we get $x-3=0$, which implies $x=3$, and $x^2-9=0$, which implies $x=\pm3$.

## Step 3: Since there are multiple possible solutions, we need to check each one.
Plugging $x=3$ back into the original equation, we get $(3)^3-3(3)^2-9(3)+15=0$, which is true.

## Step 4: Since the equation is satisfied, the solution is correct.
The value of x is $\boxed{3}$.

## Step 5: Since x = -3 is also a solution, we need to check it.
Plugging $x=-3$ back into the original equation, we get $(-3)^3-3(-3)^2-9(-3)+15=0$, which is true.

## Step 6: Since the equation is satisfied, the solution is correct.
The value of x is $\boxed{-3}$.

Since the discriminant must be greater than zero, we have $m^2-64>0$, which can be rewritten as $m^2>64$. This implies that $m>8$ or $m<-8$. Therefore, the possible values of $m$ are $(-\infty,-8)\cup(8,\infty)$.

Find the largest number of positive integers $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$ such that $x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_n = 10$ and $x_i > 0$ for all $i$?


We can start by trying to find the largest possible number of $x_i$ if $x_i = 1$.
If we set $x_i = 1$, then we must have $n \geq 10$, but if $n \geq 10$, then the sum would be greater than 10, so we must have $n \leq 9$.
If $n = 9$, then $x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_9 = 9$, and if we set $x_9 = 1$, then $x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_8 = 8$, and if we set $x_8 = 1$, then $x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_7 = 7$, and so on.

What is the minimum value of the expression $f(x) = (x^2-5x+5)^2 + (x^2-10x+25) + (x^2-15x+75)$?


We can simplify the expression further by expanding the squares and combining like terms:
f(x) = (x^2-5x+5)^2 + (x^2-10x+25) + (x^2-15x+75)
= (x^4-10x^3+35x^2-50x+25) + (x^2-10x+25) + (x^2-15x+75)
= x^6-15x^5+51x^4-95x^3+150x^2-90x+125
Since the expression is a polynomial of degree 6, we can find its minimum value by taking the derivative and setting it equal to zero.
Let's take the derivative of f(x) with respect to x:
f'(x) = 6x^5-75x^4+204x^3-285x^2+300x-150
Now, set f'(x) equal to zero and solve for x:
6x^5-75x^4+204x^3-285x^2+300x-150 = 0
This is a fifth degree polynomial equation, which is a very difficult equation to solve. However, we can try to find an approximate solution using numerical methods.

## Step 9: To find the inverse of h(x), we need to swap x and y and then solve for y.
The equation becomes x = 7y - 2.

## Step 10: Solve the equation for y to find the inverse of h(x).
Add 2 to both sides: x + 2 = 7y.

111,8,"Since we know that A = 12 is a possible value of A, we can substitute this value into the equation to find the corresponding values of B and C. If A = 12, then B = 243/(4*12^2) = 243/576 = 27/64, and C = 18.
Now we can find the value of A + B + C.
A + B + C = 12 + 27/64 + 18 = 12 + 0.421875 + 18 = 30.421875
Since A, B, and C are positive integers, the value of A + B + C should be an integer. However, the value of A + B + C is not an integer. This means that the assumption that A = 12 is not correct. Therefore, we need to try another value of A.

## Step 1: Restate the problem goal
The problem goal is to find the value of $n$ that satisfies the equation $9^{18n}=27^{24}$.

## Step 2: Rewrite the equation with the same base
Since $9=3^2$ and $27=3^3$, we can rewrite the equation as $(3^2)^{18n}=(3^3)^{24}$.

## Step 3: Simplify the equation
Using the property of exponents that $(a^m)^n=a^{mn}$, we can simplify the equation to $3^{36n}=3^{72}$.

## Step 4: Equate the exponents
Since the bases are the same, we can equate the exponents: $36n=72$.

## Step 5: Solve for n
Dividing both sides of the equation by 36, we get $n=2$.

## Step 6: Check the answer
Substituting $n=2$ into the original equation, we get $9^{18(2)}=27^{24}$, which simplifies to $9^{36}=27^{24}$. Since $9=3^2$ and $27=3^3"

Let the smaller number be 2x and the larger number be 5x.
###
## Step 1: Define the current state of the problem
Let the smaller number be 2x and the larger number be 5x.

## Step 2: Express the given information in terms of the current state
We know that adding 3 to the smaller number and 2 to the larger number results in a new ratio of $5:8$. This can be expressed as:
(2x + 3)/(5x + 2) = 5/8


## Step 3: Cross multiply and simplify the equation
Cross multiplying the equation gives:
8(2x + 3) = 5(5x + 2)


## Step 4: Expand and solve for x
Expanding the equation gives:
16x + 24 = 25x + 10


## Step 5: Rearrange the equation to isolate x
Subtracting 16x from both sides gives:

## Step 6: Solve for x
Subtracting 10 from both sides gives:

Use the quadratic formula to solve for $t$.

## Step 1: Write down the quadratic formula
The quadratic formula is $t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.

## Step 2: Identify the coefficients of the quadratic equation
The coefficients of the quadratic equation are $a = 4.9$, $b = 3.5$, and $c = -2.4$.

## Step 3: Substitute the coefficients into the quadratic formula
Substituting the coefficients into the quadratic formula gives $t = \frac{-3.5 \pm \sqrt{(3.5)^2 - 4\cdot 4.9\cdot (-2.4)}}{2\cdot 4.9}$.

## Step 4: Simplify the expression under the square root
The expression under the square root is $(3.5)^2 - 4\cdot 4.9\cdot (-2.4) = 12.25 + 47.52 = 59.77$.

## Step 5: Simplify the quadratic formula
The quadratic formula simplifies to $t = \frac{-3.5 \pm \sqrt{59.77}}{9.8}$.

## Step 6: Calculate the square root
The square root of $59.77$ is approximately $7.72$.

## Step 7: Simplify the quadratic formula further
The quadratic formula further simplifies to $t = \frac{-3.5 \pm 7.72}{9.8}$.

## Step 8: Calculate the two possible values for t
The two possible values for $t$ are $t_1 = \frac{-3.5 + 7.72}{9.8}$ and $t_2 = \frac{-3.5 - 7.72}{9.8}$.

## Step 9: Calculate the two possible values for t
Calculating the two possible values for $t$ gives us $t_1 = \frac{4.22}{9.8} \approx 0.43$ and $t_2 = \frac{-11.22}{9.8} \approx -1.15$.

## Step 10: Choose the physically meaningful solution
Since time cannot be negative, the only physically meaningful solution is $t_1 \approx 0.43$.

## Step 11: Round the answer to the nearest hundredth
Rounding the answer to the nearest hundredth gives $t \approx 0.43$.
