## Step 1: Define the problem and the current state
The problem goal is to find the positive difference between $120\%$ of 30 and $130\%$ of 20. The current state is the step-by-step calculation to solve the problem, which is: One hundred twenty percent of 30 is $120\cdot30\cdot\(1/100)=36$, and $130\%$ of 20 is $ 130\cdot 20\cdot\(1/100)=26$.

## Step 2: Determine the next step
The next step is to calculate the difference between the two values obtained from the current state, which is 36 and 26.

## Step 3: Calculate the difference
The difference between 36 and 26 is $\boxed{10}$.

## Step 4: Reiterate the current state if the problem is solved
Since the difference between 36 and 26 is calculated, the problem is solved. Reiterate the current state value.

Finally, $i^{45}$ can be rewritten as $i^{4\cdot 11+1}=i^{4\cdot 11}\cdot i^1=(i^4)^{11}\cdot i=1\cdot i=i$. Therefore, $i^5+i^{-25}+i^{45}=i-(-i)+i=3i$.

We can set up a proportion with the ratio of calories per fluid ounce in the 8 fluid ounce bottle and the ratio of calories per fluid ounce in the 12 fluid ounce bottle. Since we know that the 8 fluid ounce bottle contains 125 calories, we can set up the following proportion:
125 calories / 8 fluid ounces = x calories / 12 fluid ounces
We can then solve for x by cross-multiplying and dividing:
x = (125 calories \* 12 fluid ounces) / 8 fluid ounces

14,5,"We can start by factoring the numerator of the expression $\frac{2^4-2^3}{2^3-2^2}$.

## Step 1: Factor the numerator and denominator.
The numerator can be factored as $2^3(2-1)=2^3$, and the denominator can be factored as $2^2(2-1)=2^2$.

## Step 2: Cancel common factors.
The expression can be simplified to $\frac{2^3}{2^2}=2$.

###
Problem Goal:
What is the value of $y$ in the equation $y^2-4y+4=0$.

We can start by factoring the left side of the equation as $(y-2)^2=0$.

## Step 1: Solve for y.
$(y-2)^2=0$ implies that $y-2=0$, so $y=2$.

## Step 2: Verify the solution.
Plugging $y=2$ back into the original equation, we get $(2)^2-4(2)+4=0$, which is true.

## Step 3: Since the equation is satisfied, the solution is correct.
The value of y is $\boxed{2}$.
###
Problem Goal:
Find the value of $y$ in the equation $y^3+2y^2+3y+1=0$.

We can start by trying to factor the left side of the equation.

## Step 1: Factor the left side of the equation.
The left side can be factored as $(y+1)(y^2+y+1)=0$.

## Step 2: Solve for y.
Setting each factor equal to zero, we get $y+1=0$, which implies $y=-1$, and $y^2+y+1=0$, which has no real solutions.

## Step 3: Since there are no other real solutions, the value of y is $\boxed{-1}$.
The value of y is $\boxed{-1}$.
###
Problem Goal:
Find the value of $x$ in the equation $x^3-3x^2-9x+15=0$.

We can start by trying to factor the left side of the equation.

## Step 1: Factor the left side of the equation.
The left side can be factored as $(x-3)(x^2-9)=0$.

## Step 2: Solve for x.
Setting each factor equal to zero, we get $x-3=0$, which implies $x=3$, and $x^2-9=0$, which implies $x=\pm3$.

## Step 3: Since there are multiple possible solutions, we need to check each one.
Plugging $x=3$ back into the original equation, we get $(3)^3-3(3)^2-9(3)+15=0$, which is true.

## Step 4: Since the equation is satisfied, the solution is correct.
The value of x is $\boxed{3}$.

## Step 5: Since x = -3 is also a solution, we need to check it.
Plugging $x=-3$ back into the original equation, we get $(-3)^3-3(-3)^2-9(-3)+15=0$, which is true.

## Step 6: Since the equation is satisfied, the solution is correct.
The value of x is $\boxed{-3}$.

The discriminant is given by the formula $b^2-4ac$, where $a=2$, $b=m$, and $c=8$. Therefore, the discriminant is $m^2-4(2)(8)=m^2-64$. Since the discriminant must be greater than zero, we have $m^2-64>0$, which can be rewritten as $m^2>64$. This implies that $m>8$ or $m<-8$. Therefore, the possible values of $m$ are $(-\infty,-8)\cup(8,\infty)$.
