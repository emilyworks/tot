## Step 1: Understand the problem and the current state
The problem is to evaluate the expression $i^5+i^{-25}+i^{45}$. The current state is the result of simplifying the powers of $i$: $i^5 = i$, $i^{-25} = i^{-24} \cdot i^{-1} = i$, and $i^{45} = i^{44} \cdot i = i$.

## Step 2: Substitute the simplified values into the original expression
Substitute the simplified values of $i^5$, $i^{-25}$, and $i^{45}$ into the original expression: $i^5 + i^{-25} + i^{45} = i - i - 1$.

11,8,"Since we found the values of A, B, and C that satisfy the equation, we can conclude that the problem is solved, and the final answer is 13.
However, the problem statement asks for a possible next step to solve the problem from the current state, not the final answer. In this case, the next step is to try different values of A until we find one that satisfies the equation.

### Problem Goal:
If $A$, $B$ and $C$ are positive integers such that $\frac{A\sqrt{B}}{C} = \frac{9}{2\sqrt{3}}$, what is the value of $A+B+C$ given that $A$ and $C$ have no common prime factors, and $B$ has no perfect-square factors other than 1?


## Step 1: Analyze the equation
We need to find the value of A+B+C. To start, we need to analyze the given equation and simplify it.

## Step 2: Simplify the equation
We can simplify the equation by multiplying both sides by 2*sqrt(3) to get A*sqrt(B) = (9/(2*sqrt(3))) * (2*sqrt(3)) = 9.

## Step 3: Isolate A
We can isolate A by dividing both sides by sqrt(B) to get A = 9 / sqrt(B).

## Step 4: Simplify B
We can simplify B by using the fact that sqrt(B) = sqrt(27/A^2) = sqrt(27)/A = 3*sqrt(3)/A.

## Step 5: Substitute B into the equation for A
We can substitute B into the equation for A to get A = 9 / (3*sqrt(3)/A) = 3*A / sqrt(3).

## Step 6: Simplify the equation for A
We can simplify the equation for A by multiplying both sides by sqrt(3) to get A*sqrt(3) = 3*A.

## Step 7: Solve for A
We can solve for A by dividing both sides by A to get sqrt(3) = 3.

## Step 8: Solve for A
However, this equation is not true, so we must try another approach.

## Step 9: Simplify the equation for B
We can simplify the equation for B by using the fact that A*sqrt(B) = 9.

## Step 10: Substitute A into the equation for B
We can substitute A into the equation for B to get sqrt(B) = 9/A.

## Step 11: Square both sides
We can square both sides to get B = (9/A)^2 = 81/A^2.

## Step 12: Consider possible values for A
Since A and C have no common prime factors, A must be a multiple of 3.

## Step 13: Try A = 3
If A = 3, then B = 81/9 = 9, which means C = 9/3 = 3. However, this contradicts the fact that A and C have no common prime factors.

## Step 14: Try A = 9
If A = 9, then B = 81/81 = 1, which means C = 9/3 = 3. This is a possible solution.

## Step 15: Calculate A + B + C
We can calculate A + B + C = 9 + 1 + 3 = 13.

The final answer is: $\boxed{13}$"
